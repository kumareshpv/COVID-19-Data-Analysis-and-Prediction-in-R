# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Prediction in R

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting COVID-19 death cases using R. The analysis was conducted from November 2023 to December 2023. The primary goals of the project were to improve the quality of the COVID-19 dataset through data cleaning, visualize relationships within the data, and develop accurate predictive models.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Applied various data cleaning techniques to reduce noise and improve the overall quality of the dataset.
- **Data Visualization**: Generated over 5 diagrams to identify and visualize key relationships within the data.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed multiple regression models to predict the number of death cases, achieving an accuracy rate of 92%.

## Data Cleaning

The COVID-19 dataset initially contained several inconsistencies and missing values. To enhance the data quality:

- Missing values were handled using imputation techniques.
- Outliers were detected and treated.
- Data was normalized to ensure consistency across various metrics.

These steps significantly reduced noise in the dataset, making it more reliable for further analysis.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization played a crucial role in understanding the trends and relationships within the COVID-19 dataset. The following diagrams were created:

1. **Scatter Plot**: To observe the relationship between confirmed cases and deaths.
2. **Line Chart**: Showing the trend of confirmed cases and deaths over time.
3. **Bar Chart**: Comparing death cases across different regions.
4. **Heatmap**: Displaying the correlation between various features in the dataset.
5. **Box Plot**: To detect and visualize outliers in the data.

These visualizations helped in formulating hypotheses and guided the development of predictive models.

## Predictive Modeling

The core of this project is the development of regression models to predict COVID-19 death cases. The models were evaluated based on their accuracy, with the final model achieving a 92% accuracy rate. The steps involved in model development include:

- Feature selection and engineering.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Training multiple regression models and selecting the best-performing model.
- Evaluating the model's performance using various metrics.
